# lib32-llvm-svn

This is an [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) Linux [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) for the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure, the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) frontend, and the various tools associated with it. It's available in the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) as [lib32-llvm-svn](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/lib32-llvm-svn/). Unlike the [official package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/lib32-llvm-libs/), which provides the latest stable release, this one builds the code straight from the SVN source repository, where development is constantly taking place. Thus, it brings all the latest bells and whistles, but also tends to bring and all the latest bugs. __You've been warned.__

Main development is in the master branch, while the AUR git repo is mirrored by the [aur](https://github.com/kerberizer/lib32-llvm-svn/tree/aur) branch.
